aku dah bangun
sejak subuh tunggu zohor
gendang melambung
atap zink diketuk sudah bocor
angkuh-angkuh prasaan dirasa.
jangan nak mengada ini citarasa raksasa

im awake
since dawn ive been waiting for noon to arrive
bouncing percussions
hits the zinc roof until it is broken
arrogance emoted
don't be a fool, this is a monster's palate

kena makan sekor-sekor
jangan bergerak
aku nampak dari jauh
ambil snapang cepat tembak bila dia jatuh
cepat raih boleh kuat gelak
tendang hina ludah lepas dipijak
makan penumbuk sampai tak boleh bergerak

one by one they were eaten
do not move
i can see from afar
hand me my rifle and shoot him as he falls
hastily we shall cheer and laugh
kick him with contempt and spit on him after stomping him
eat these fists until he cant move

jangan malu-malu
mulut busuk dah musuk
gusi berdarah kuman virus panrah
orang tua mula melatah
tukar-tukar jadi sumpah

dont be shy
my ugly breath has entered
my bleeding gums with its germs and viruses
the old man mumbles
his mumbles shall turn into curses

kenapa boleh merepek
ikut kerenah?

why can one gibber
when following his will?
